# Chat App

A simple real-time chat application built with **Node.js** and **Socket.IO**.  
The app allows multiple users to join, send messages, and see when others connect or disconnect.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time messaging with Socket.IO  
- Displays when users join or leave  
- Basic styled chat interface (bubbles for you/others + system messages)

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements
This is an early version of the project. In the future, I plan to:
- Add authentication (user accounts, login, etc.)  
- Use frameworks like **React** or **Vue** for the frontend  
- Explore using different programming languages for the backend  
- Add more chat features (private rooms, file sharing, typing indicators, etc.)
